### Computer Modelling in Chemical Technology: Scilab worked examples

#### MINIPROJECTS


---


##### Miniproject 1

```scilab
Do analysis of model of extraction (Example 2.3):
How K impacts to recovery factor (r)?  
What is influence of amount of org solvent used (F2) on r?
Prepare plots to ilustrate your answers.
Try to use Scilab loops to collect data.
```

##### Miniproject 2

```scilab
Consider esterification process of mixture of ethanol and 1-propanol by acetic acid:

EtOH + CH3COOH <=> CH3COOEt + H2O, K1

PrOH + CH3COOH <=> CH3COOPr + H2O, K2

Calculate equilibrium concentrations of reagents if K1 = 4.9 and K2 = 4.2 and 
initial concentrations of substrates are: 
cCH3COOH = 3mol/L
cEtOH = 7mol/L
cPrOH = 6 mol/L
```

##### Miniproject 3

Comming soon.
